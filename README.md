Landing WebpageMernStack


To create a landing web page using the MERN stack, you would need to use the following technologies:

MongoDB: a NoSQL database used to store and manage data
Express.js: a web framework used to build server-side applications
React.js: a frontend library used to build interactive user interfaces
Node.js: a JavaScript runtime used to build server-side applications
Here are the general steps you can follow to create a landing web page using the MERN stack:

Set up a MongoDB database: This involves creating a database, collections, and defining the schema of your data. You can use the MongoDB Atlas cloud service to create a database or install it on your local machine.

Create a backend API using Express.js and Node.js: This involves defining routes and creating endpoints that interact with your database to retrieve and manipulate data. You can use libraries like Mongoose to simplify database interactions.

Build the frontend using React.js: This involves creating components, defining state, and rendering data received from the backend API. You can use libraries like Axios to fetch data from the backend API.

Deploy your application: You can deploy your application to a hosting service like Heroku, AWS, or Firebase.
